Overview of complex numbers calculator by Kozlov Ilia

This method includes several  stages described in submethods which are internally processed:

Stage 1 

Filtering stage. Input data is received. Then the input data is filtered to check where complex numbers are and what kind of operations to be done.

Stage 2

Computational Stage. Once mathematical operation is difined and input numbers are prepared for further processing, the operation is performed. There are four kinds of operations described in the relevant submethods: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each submethod is based on relevant algebraic formula.

Stage 3

Result Stage. Once the operation is completed, the Result is returned.
